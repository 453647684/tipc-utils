TIPC utilities package for Linux README
       
Last updated: 04 May 2010


This directory contains a variety of utility programs for use with Linux TIPC,
including:

1) tipc-config
An application for run-time configuration and monitoring of TIPC.

2) PTTS (Portable TIPC Test Suite)
A basic sanity test suite that can be used to verify that major aspects of TIPC
are operating correctly.

3) TIPC demos
A collection of demo programs.  The benchmark and inventory simulation demos
can be helpful in stressing certain aspects of TIPC beyond the areas covered
by PTTS.


Building the utilities package
------------------------------
The master makefile for the utilities package allows you to build all programs
in a single operation.  (If desired, you can also build a specific utility
individually from its own sub-directory.)

Just do a normal build; the master makefile should locate the necessary TIPC
include files automatically.

eg. cd <top level utility package directory>
    make

If the TIPC include files are not properly located, find the directory that
contains the files linux/tipc.h and linux/tipc_config.h and specify this
directory in the make command:

eg. cd < level utility package directory>
    make INCLUDE_PATH=<path to directory containing linux/tipc.h>

Note: In the standard Linux kernel source tree, this directory is located
at <top of source tree>/include.


The build procedure produces executable programs in the various sub-directories
that make up the package.


Additional rules:

1) make clean		- deletes all utility package executables


Running the utilities package
-----------------------------
Consult the README file in each sub-directory for further details on using
the associated application.
