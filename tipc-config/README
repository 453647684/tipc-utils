tipc-config for Linux README
       
Last updated: 04 May 2010


This directory contains the configuration tool used with Linux TIPC.


Building the tool
-----------------
Do a normal build; the tool's makefile should locate the necessary TIPC
include files automatically.

eg. cd <tipc-config directory>
    make


If the TIPC include files are not properly located, find the directory that
contains the files linux/tipc.h and linux/tipc_config.h and specify this
directory in the make command:

eg. cd <tipc-config directory>
    make INCLUDE_PATH=<path to directory containing linux/tipc.h>

Note: In the standard Linux kernel source tree, this directory is located
at <top of source tree>/include.


The build procedure produces a "tipc-config" exectuable.


Additional rules:

1) make clean		- deletes the tipc-config executables


Running the tool
----------------
Enter "tipc-config -help" to obtain a list of the commands supported by the
configuration tool.

More information about these commands can be found in the TIPC User's Guide
(http://tipc.sourceforge.net/documentation.html).
