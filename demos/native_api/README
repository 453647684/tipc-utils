Linux TIPC Native API Demo Programs README
       
Last updated: 01 September 2006


This directory contains demo programs that utilize TIPC's native API.


Brief descriptions
------------------
hello_world
    Implements the server portion of TIPC's "hello word" application.
    (Unlike the user space version, the server runs until told to stop.)

connection_demo
    Implements the server portion of TIPC's connection_demo application.
    (Unlike the user space version, the server runs until told to stop.)    


Building the demos
------------------
The author used the following approach on his TIPC 1.6-based system to build
the loadable kernel module associated with a given demo.

eg.   cd <top level of kernel source tree>
      cp -r <...>/hello_world .
      cd hello_world
      make

You may have to use a different procedure for your system.  If you are using
TIPC 1.5 you'll also have to edit the #include paths used in the .c files,
since things were different then.  If you need help, you can find lots of 
useful info on building and running Linux kernel modules at
http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/html/index.html.

TO DO:
- Add a top level makefile to allow all demos to be built at once.
- Fix things up so that the demos can be easily built in both TIPC 1.5 and 1.6
  environments.


Running the demos
-----------------
To start a demo, install the loadable module(s) in the standard manner;
likewise, to terminate a demo just unload the module.  (Remember you'll need
to have "root" privileges to perform these operations.)
  
eg.   insmod hello_world/tipc_hello_server.ko
      ...
      rmmod tipc_hello_server

Any output generated by a demo will captured in the Linux system message log.

eg.   dmesg | tail
